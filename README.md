# Pimp

![language: python][shield-language] ![license: GPL][shield-license] ![python: 3.7][shield-python-version]

Pimp is a Python-script that enhance multiple images from a single
command line by changing their contrast and saturation level.

## Getting Started

This instructions will give you a copy of the source code of the
software, as well as its minimal configuration to run it properly.

### Prerequisites

*This section is still in progress*

You need [Python 3.7][python 3.7] to execute this script.

Here is a list of Python package to install to make this program
works:

```bash
pip install typeguard
pip install pillow
```

if you use Anaconda, use the following commands:

*On Unix:*

```bash
source activate <env>
pip install typeguard
pip install pillow
```

*On Windows:*

```bash
activate <env>
pip install typeguard
pip install pillow
```

### Installing

To install this script, simply download the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cynnexis/Pimp/master/pimp.py),
or clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cynnexis/Pimp.git
```

### Running the script

To run the script, use the following commands:

```bash
cd pimp/
python pimp.py -i images/* -o pimped-images/ -c 20 -s 1.2
```

This will take all images in the folder `images/`, process them and save the results
in `pimped-images/`. The contrast level is **20**, and the saturation level is
**1.2**.

The following is the list of all parameters:

* `-i`/`--images`: The images. All given images will be loaded, modified and
then saved somewhere else. The original images will not be changed, unless the
option `-f` (`--force-overwrite`) is given.

* `-o`/`--output`: The directory output. This option is compatible with `-f`
(`--force-overwrite`), that will save the copy of the image in the given
output folder and overwrite the original images. Note that this parameter is
required, except in the case where `-f` is used, where it becomes optional.

* `-f`/`--force-overwrite`: The given images will be overwritten. Be very
careful using this option.

* `-c`/`--contrast`: The contrast level to apply to all images.

* `-s`/`--saturation`:The saturation level to apply to all images.

## Built With

* [Python 3.7][python 3.7]
